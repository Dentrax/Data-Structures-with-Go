## What It Is

Given pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list. We need to reverse the list by changing links between nodes.


> * Input: Head of following linked list `[1->2->3->4->NULL]`
> * Output: Linked list should be changed to `[4->3->2->1->NULL]`

> * Input: Head of following linked list `[1->2->3->4->5->NULL]`
> * Output: Linked list should be changed to `[5->4->3->2->1->NULL]`
